To detect if you are at home, Gladys uses events.

First, to know in which home your Raspberry Pi (the machine running Gladys) is located, Gladys uses "machines" (you can configure it in parameters).
Especially the "me" field. She takes the machine where "me" is true.

Then, she looks at events "back-at-home" and "left-home".

If last event for this particular house and with your user ID is "back-at-home", it means you are at home.

If not, it means your are in another place.

```
gladys.modules.voicerss.say({text:"MyText", language:"fr-fr"})
```
